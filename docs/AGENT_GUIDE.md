# Agent repository guide

## Mental model

OpenInstinct is a personal browser-using assistant delivered through a Next.js
web app and an Eve agent runtime. Next owns the authenticated manager UI,
Better Auth, tRPC, and artifact delivery. Eve owns durable sessions, model
turns, channels, tools, and the delegated browser worker. The root agent
coordinates the user conversation; the worker is the only agent allowed to
operate a browser or inject vault values.

The repository is Vercel-first today. Treat self-hosting and multi-tenancy as
documented direction unless a change explicitly implements them.

Read [`README.md`](README.md) for the documentation map and truth labels.
Product work involving configurable agents, managed lines, MCP/tool catalogs,
public APIs, or customer webhooks starts with
[`PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md`](PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md) and
[`MULTITENANCY.md`](MULTITENANCY.md). Those are proposed contracts, not schema
or runtime claims.

## Route map

| Route                        | Owner                                          | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/`                          | `app/(authenticated)/(manager)/page.tsx`       | Workspace manager and connector status          |
| `/chat`, `/chat/[sessionId]` | `app/(authenticated)/(manager)/chat/`          | Web chat and Eve session stream                 |
| `/chats`                     | `app/(authenticated)/(manager)/chats/page.tsx` | Workspace chat list                             |
| `/tasks`, `/runs/[groupId]`  | `app/(authenticated)/(tasks)/`                 | Browser task history and run details            |
| `/vault`                     | `app/(authenticated)/(manager)/vault/`         | Vault metadata and secure setup/import UI       |
| `/api/auth/[...all]`         | `app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`               | Better Auth API                                 |
| `/api/trpc/[trpc]`           | `app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`                 | Authenticated application RPC                   |
| `/eve/v1/*`                  | `agent/channels/`, Eve generated service       | Eve sessions, streams, health, and Linq webhook |
| `/artifacts/[artifactId]`    | `app/artifacts/[artifactId]/route.ts`          | Scoped private browser image delivery           |

`proxy.ts` protects the web surface and authenticated Eve browser sessions.
The Eve channel performs its own session ownership check; do not assume a
Next redirect is an Eve authorization decision.

## Directory ownership and dependency direction

- `app/`: pages, layouts, and browser UI. Call application data through tRPC.
- `components/`: reusable UI primitives and AI presentation components.
- `agent/`: Eve agent declarations, instructions, channels, memory, hooks, and tools.
- `agent/channels/scheduled-run.ts`: internal channel a cron job (`agent/schedules/dynamic.ts`) dispatches onto to run a scheduled job's turn; `agent/hooks/scheduled-run-completion.ts` tracks its lease and reports the outcome back.
- `agent/subagents/browser-agent/`: the isolated browser worker and its flat tool surface.
- `agent/instructions/`: root instructions, split into ordered `*.ts` modules whose content lives under `agent/instructions/content/**.md` (interactive, scheduled-report, scheduled-worker role variants); `agent/instructions.md` is now a stub.
- `auth/`: Better Auth configuration, phone normalization, and Linq OTP delivery.
- `trpc/`: request context and the application router.
- `db/schema/`: Drizzle source of truth; `db/services/` owns scoped queries.
- `lib/`: shared schemas, scope derivation, Kernel, vault, images, models, and adapters.
- `db/migrations/`: committed SQL history. Never hand-edit generated snapshots.
- `scripts/`: local supervisors and benchmark utilities.
- `docs/`: operational and architectural contracts.

The normal dependency flow is `app -> trpc -> lib/db services -> external
provider`. Agent tools may use shared server services, but browser tools stay
under the worker directory. Do not add a root browser connection or move vault
secrets into UI state.

## Identity, tenant, and session flow

```text
Better Auth user/session
          |
          v
accessScopeForUser("better-auth:<userId>")
          |
          v
{ userId, workspaceId: personal:<hash> }
          |
          +--> scoped DB queries and vault
          +--> agent session ownership
          +--> worker root/child lineage checks
          +--> Kernel profile and private image namespace
```

`requireRequestScope()` is the server entrypoint for web requests. It and Eve
channel auth require an active verified membership. Linq admits only a verified
phone identity with an active scope and a durable provider-conversation binding
owned by that workspace; missing or ambiguous bindings fail closed. Never
accept a client-supplied workspace ID as authority.

## Browser-worker boundary

The root agent delegates a bounded assignment to `worker`. The worker must use
only its declared tools, an owned browser session, and opaque vault handles.
`requireWorkerScope()` proves both the worker session and its root session are
owned by the current scope. `requireOwnedBrowserSession()` adds the workspace
check before Kernel calls.

Use `list_vault` for safe metadata, then `fill_from_vault` with only the opaque
handle and browser session ID. Never return or inspect injected values. Keep
routine inspection and reversible preparation on the curated semantic tools.
Raw Playwright, coordinate mutation, clipboard access, and model-facing clicks
are unavailable. Submit, purchase, message, and delete actions converge on the
Eve-approved commit tool, which rechecks the owned browser, exact origin,
frame, observed ref, label, action class, and material terms immediately before
dispatch. Treat an uncertain dispatch as uncertain; never retry it automatically.

## Storage and migration rules

- Runtime queries use pooled `DATABASE_URL` through `db/index.ts`.
- Migration commands use direct `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` through
  `db/drizzle.config.ts`.
- Change the Drizzle schema first, run `pnpm db:generate`, and commit SQL,
  snapshots, and journal together.
- Use `ensureScope()` before writes that create a workspace-owned record.
- Include workspace predicates on every read, update, and delete.
- Vault secrets are encrypted before Postgres storage; metadata and secret rows
  must never be returned together as plaintext.
- Browser image storage needs a private Blob store/token. Artifact reads are
  scoped and hash-checked.
- Local development uses Docker Compose Postgres and the generated random
  loopback port owned by `scripts/dev.mjs`.

## Command matrix

| Situation               | Command                      | Notes                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| First local setup       | `./init.sh`                  | Copies `.env.example` only when `.env.local` is absent, then delegates to `pnpm dev`. |
| Check prerequisites     | `./init.sh --check`          | Non-mutating Node 24, pnpm, Docker, and Compose check.                                |
| Install only            | `./init.sh --setup-only`     | Preserves `.env.local`; installs dependencies.                                        |
| Local app lifecycle     | `pnpm dev`                   | Starts Postgres, migrates, runs Next, and tears down the container on exit.           |
| App-only local run      | `pnpm dev:app`               | Use only with an externally managed database.                                         |
| Unit/integration tests  | `pnpm test`                  | Vitest suite; provider calls are mocked.                                              |
| Repository gate         | `pnpm check`                 | Lint, typecheck, tests, formatting, Knip, and boundaries.                             |
| Web build               | `pnpm build`                 | Next production build; does not itself provision infrastructure.                      |
| Eve production artifact | `pnpm build:eve`             | Required before a non-Vercel Eve service can start.                                   |
| Eve process             | `pnpm start:eve`             | Run under a supervisor with persistent `.eve` state when self-hosting.                |
| Vercel deployment       | `pnpm deploy` / `eve deploy` | Follow `docs/operations/VERCEL.md`; operator action.                                  |

## Change recipes

1. **Add a scoped data field:** update the owning schema, migration, service,
   schema validation, and service test. Include tenant predicates and FKs.
2. **Add an agent capability:** decide root versus worker ownership first,
   define a strict input/output schema, enforce authorization in code, then
   add a focused tool-boundary test.
3. **Add a connector:** prefer the existing registry/integration path, define
   environment validation and failure states, keep tokens out of chat/history,
   and add mocked contract tests.
4. **Add tenant-configurable capability:** keep configuration as validated data;
   resolve workspace/agent/revision from verified auth, expose only a reviewed
   catalog/allow-list, and enforce authorization plus approval in the executor.
   Do not compile or evaluate tenant-provided JavaScript.
5. **Change auth or routes:** test unauthenticated, authenticated, wrong-owner,
   and cross-origin cases. Test both Next proxy behavior and generated Eve routes.
6. **Change local startup:** preserve `scripts/dev.mjs` ownership of Compose,
   signal forwarding, dynamic port injection, migration, and teardown.

## Non-negotiable gates

Before handoff, run `pnpm check`, `pnpm build`, and `git diff --check`. For UI
changes, use a real local browser smoke after automated checks. For deployment
changes, prove one complete web-chat turn and one complete Linq turn; health
alone is insufficient. Do not claim production readiness from local tests.

## Common traps

- `@workflow/world-vercel` and Vercel Connect are not portable-provider support.
- Local phone code `000000` is a development bypass, not a Linq delivery test.
- The global configured Linq line is not a tenant model.
- A workspace is the tenant; an agent, revision, line, participant, and user are
  distinct resources. Never collapse them into one ID because the MVP has one
  of each.
- Current Eve dynamic capability resolution does not make arbitrary tenant MCP
  endpoints safe. Follow the curated-catalog/broker design before adding them.
- Workspace columns without server-derived membership authorization are not true
  multi-tenancy.
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` and `KERNEL_API_KEY` must never be printed or committed.
- In-memory channel state and local workflow state do not survive arbitrary
  process replacement without persistent backing storage.
- A successful typecheck does not prove Eve route rewrites, webhooks, or external
  provider credentials work.

## Bounded discovery checklist

1. Confirm the base SHA and clean worktree.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`, the relevant package docs, and the nearest tests.
3. Trace identity to `AccessScope` before touching data access.
4. Identify whether the change belongs to Next, Eve root, worker, service, or DB.
5. Search for an existing owning schema/type/service before adding one.
6. Add the smallest focused test, then run `pnpm check` and `pnpm build`.
7. Inspect the real rendered/runtime path when the change crosses a route or UI.
