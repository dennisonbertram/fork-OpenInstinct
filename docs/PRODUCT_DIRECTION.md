# Product direction: agent infrastructure first

Status: **proposed product decision**, not implemented.

## Recommendation

Build OpenInstinct first as an agent infrastructure service: a customer creates
a workspace, creates and configures an agent, attaches approved tools or MCP
connections, links a verified phone identity, and reaches that agent through a
shared platform number, dashboard, and versioned API. Offer dedicated numbers
later as a premium channel. Add the consumer text-to-create experience as a
product shell on the same control plane.

This sequencing preserves both ideas. The infrastructure product forces the
hard primitives—tenant isolation, agent versions, channel routing, connection
auth, approvals, usage, API keys, webhooks, and lifecycle—to become explicit.
The consumer product can then compose those primitives into a conversational
onboarding flow without becoming a separate architecture.

## The two paths

| Question              | Agent infrastructure service                          | Consumer text-to-create bot                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary buyer         | Builder, operator, business, agency                   | Individual, organizer, group host                           |
| First interaction     | Dashboard/API signup                                  | Text a platform number                                      |
| Configuration         | UI plus API; versioned and reviewable                 | Conversational wizard                                       |
| Distribution          | API, webhook, shared platform number, embedded chat   | Invite a participant or add the bot to a group              |
| Tool model            | Curated tools/MCP first; policy-controlled            | Templates with a narrow safe catalog                        |
| Main value            | Programmable agent infrastructure                     | Fast creation and social sharing                            |
| Hardest early problem | Secure tenant-configurable capabilities               | Identity, abuse, group ownership, moderation                |
| Current-code fit      | Stronger: manager, vault, tools, browser, scoped data | Weaker: no conversational provisioning or guest/group model |
| Recommended timing    | First                                                 | After the platform contracts are stable                     |

The consumer path may have better organic distribution, but it multiplies the
riskiest unresolved questions at once: who owns a bot created in a group, who
may reconfigure it, how guests consent to data retention and external actions,
how a number is recovered or transferred, and how abuse affects shared line
reputation. Those questions become easier when the underlying platform already
has explicit ownership and policy APIs.

## Product boundaries

Keep these concepts separate even if the first release gives every customer
exactly one of each:

- **Workspace**: customer, security tenant, billing account, quota, audit, and
  lifecycle boundary.
- **User**: authenticated human who may belong to one or more workspaces.
- **Agent**: configurable product resource owned by a workspace.
- **Agent revision**: immutable, publishable snapshot of instructions, model
  policy, enabled capabilities, and channel behavior.
- **Platform line**: a provider-owned ingress/egress number shared by many
  tenant conversations. It is infrastructure inventory, not a tenant identity.
- **Channel conversation**: a verified provider thread bound server-side to one
  workspace, agent, and participant set. A new session pins that agent's active
  revision.
- **Participant**: an identity allowed to talk to an agent on a channel; this is
  distinct from a workspace member who can administer it.
- **Connection installation**: tenant-owned authorization and policy for an
  external MCP/API service.
- **Run/session**: durable conversation execution pinned to one workspace,
  agent, revision, channel, and initiating principal.

The invariant is:

```text
signed provider event + verified phone identity
                         |
                         v
provider conversation binding -> workspace -> agent -> published revision
                                               |
                                               +-> allowed capabilities
                                               +-> session/run -> usage + audit
```

Neither a prompt, a raw phone number in a request body, nor a model-generated
tool argument may select another workspace or agent. The platform line alone
never supplies tenant authority.

## Product decisions now made

- Launch agent infrastructure before the consumer text-to-create shell.
- Use one shared Vercel deployment rather than one deployment per customer.
- Use a shared platform iMessage/SMS number for the default plan. The current
  per-line economics do not support giving every early user a dedicated line.
- Resolve tenancy through a verified phone identity and a durable provider
  conversation binding, not through the destination line.
- Limit the first messaging release to one active/default agent per verified
  phone identity. Add explicit agent switching and invitations before allowing
  the same participant to reach multiple agents through the shared number.
- Treat dedicated lines as an optional premium channel with provider cost and
  operational margin passed through in pricing.
- Keep the channel contract provider-aware but portable. The current reference
  deployment uses Linq; the intended shared-number product path may use the
  existing Sendblue account through Eve's Chat SDK channel after a separate
  adapter migration and provider acceptance test.

## Infrastructure MVP

The narrow first release should support:

1. One owner signs up and receives one workspace.
2. The owner creates one agent draft and publishes immutable revisions.
3. The owner configures identity, instructions, model tier, and a curated set of
   tools/MCP integrations.
4. The owner verifies a phone identity and selects one active/default agent.
5. The owner texts the shared platform number. The signed provider event is
   bound to the verified identity, workspace, agent, and published revision.
6. The owner can also use web chat. Invited participants and agent switching
   remain disabled until their routing contracts are implemented.
7. The owner receives API credentials and can start sessions, send messages,
   read run status, and register signed webhook endpoints.
8. Every expensive or externally visible operation is subject to tenant policy,
   idempotency, quota, and audit.
9. Suspension stops new turns and side effects without deleting evidence.

Do not include arbitrary uploaded JavaScript, public anonymous agents, shared
workspace administration, marketplace billing, multi-agent SMS switching, or
dedicated-number provisioning in this first release.

## Control plane and runtime

Use one shared platform deployment initially, not one Vercel project per
customer. Per-customer Vercel projects would make rollout, migrations,
observability, incident response, and provider connector management scale with
tenant count. Isolation should come from authenticated workspace scope and
provider bindings, with dedicated deployments reserved for a later enterprise
tier when contract or residency requirements justify them.

                                              +-> Kernel
                                              +-> model
                                              +-> outbox -> customer webhooks
```

The control plane is application code and Postgres. Eve remains the durable
agent runtime. Its route auth should stamp verified `workspaceId`, `agentId`,
roles, and channel facts into the current principal. Eve dynamic instructions,
skills, tools, subagents, models, connection auth, and approval policies can
then resolve from that verified context. Eve does not supply a native tenant
object; membership, session ownership, lifecycle, and credential storage remain
application responsibilities.

## Proposed data model

Extend the existing `workspaces` and `workspace_memberships`; do not create a
parallel tenant table. Names below describe concepts, not approved migrations.

| Record                     | Required ownership and purpose                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `workspaces`               | Add display name, plan, lifecycle state, policy version, and timestamps                                         |
| `workspace_memberships`    | Add status and owner/admin/member roles with invitation provenance                                              |
| `agents`                   | Workspace-owned stable identity, slug, status, active revision, and default-channel policy                      |
| `agent_revisions`          | Immutable configuration manifest and publisher; never mutate a published row                                    |
| `agent_capabilities`       | Revision-to-curated-tool/MCP bindings and least-privilege allow-lists                                           |
| `connection_installations` | Workspace/agent provider binding, auth owner, scopes, encrypted credential reference, and state                 |
| `phone_identities`         | Encrypted normalized number, lookup hash, verification/recovery state, authenticated user, and recycling checks |
| `platform_lines`           | Provider line/connector identity, status, reputation, capacity, and environment; normally platform-owned        |
| `channel_conversations`    | Provider conversation ID bound to platform line, workspace, agent, participant set, and pinned revision         |
| `channel_participants`     | Verified sender identity, role, invitation/consent state, and conversation binding                              |
| `channel_invitations`      | Single-use or expiring join token, intended agent, inviter, status, and redemption audit                        |
| `dedicated_line_requests`  | Optional premium requested, provisioning, assigned, failed, quarantined, and released lifecycle                 |
| `api_credentials`          | Hashed credential, visible prefix, workspace, scopes, expiration, and revocation                                |
| `webhook_endpoints`        | Workspace URL, encrypted signing secret, subscribed events, status, and rotation metadata                       |
| `webhook_deliveries`       | Event/endpoint attempt ledger, response class, retry time, and terminal state                                   |
| `usage_events`             | Append-only model, browser, storage, message, and connection usage authority                                    |
| `audit_events`             | Actor, workspace, agent, action, target, outcome, correlation ID, and redacted metadata                         |

Every agent-owned record must also carry `workspace_id`; relying on an indirect
join alone makes authorization and retention harder to prove. Use composite
foreign keys or equivalent constraints so an agent cannot reference a revision,
conversation, connection, or session from another workspace.

## Agent configuration and publishing

Treat customer configuration as data, not executable source:

1. Draft changes are validated against a versioned manifest schema.
2. Tool and connection references must resolve to an approved platform catalog.
3. Publish creates an immutable revision with a content digest.
4. New sessions pin the active revision; running sessions do not silently
   acquire a new capability set.
5. Rollback moves the active pointer to a previous compatible revision and is
   recorded in audit history.

A revision should contain presentation identity, authored instructions, model
policy, enabled skills, capability bindings, approval policy references, memory
policy, channel behavior, and limits. It should contain references to secrets,
never secret values.

## Tools and MCP strategy

“Let customers add tools” must not mean “execute customer JavaScript inside the
trusted application runtime.” Use a staged model:

### Current scope: our authored integrations

We add and review integrations ourselves. Users can authorize their accounts
for integrations we ship; arbitrary customer server URLs and package installs
are outside the current scope. Native tools, OpenAPI connections (Square), and
MCP connections are distinct choices; extensions package reusable contributions.
See [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for the current implementation guide.

### Stage 1: curated catalog (Proposed product controls)

- Compile reviewed authored tools and MCP/OpenAPI connections with the app.
- Let each published agent enable a safe subset through Eve dynamic capability
  resolution.
- Resolve credentials from the verified workspace and user, never from a model
  argument.
- Apply explicit MCP operation allow-lists and tenant approval policy.
- Default writes, messages, purchases, deletes, and sensitive reads to approval.

### Stage 2: customer MCP endpoints through a broker

This is future work, not a prerequisite for our authored integrations.
Installed Eve 0.49.0 supports dynamic connection sets as well as other dynamic
capabilities; authenticated dynamic entries require a stable `instanceKey`.
That runtime support does not implement customer endpoint policy. If arbitrary
customer MCP URLs are introduced, the proposed platform-controlled broker
should:

- validate Streamable HTTP/SSE transport and tool schemas;
- block private, loopback, link-local, metadata, and disallowed destinations;
- pin DNS/TLS policy and re-check redirects to prevent SSRF;
- keep credentials in tenant-scoped encrypted storage;
- cache discovery by installation/version and enforce allow-lists server-side;
- cap request/response sizes, timeouts, concurrency, and egress;
- attach tenant and call idempotency internally, never from model authority;
- audit discovery and every call without logging credentials or sensitive
  payloads.

The model should see only approved tool names, descriptions, schemas, and
bounded results. A tenant admin must review schema changes before newly added or
materially changed write tools become available.

## Shared messaging and dedicated-number policy

The default product uses one shared platform number for many customers. The
line is not assigned to a workspace or agent. A signed inbound provider event
must instead resolve to a durable `channel_conversation` before Eve starts a
turn.

For the MVP, resolution is deliberately narrow:

1. Verify the provider webhook signature and replay window.
2. Deduplicate the provider event ID before any model call or side effect.
3. Resolve an existing
   `(provider, provider_account_id, provider_conversation_id)` binding.
4. If it exists, derive the workspace, agent, participant, platform line, and
   pinned revision entirely from server-owned records.
5. If no binding exists, match a verified phone identity with exactly one
   active/default agent, create the binding transactionally, and continue.
6. If identity is absent or agent selection is ambiguous, enter onboarding or
   explicit selection; never guess and never let message text select a tenant.

The owner may administer the agent only through normal authenticated web/API
authorization. Possession of a phone number or an inbound message is a channel
identity signal, not sufficient authority for billing, credentials, publishing,
export, or deletion.

The next messaging stage adds expiring invite codes and explicit agent
selection. Redeeming an invite creates participant membership and binds the
provider conversation to the invited agent. A participant who can reach
multiple agents through the same one-to-one provider conversation must use an
auditable `switch` operation; group conversations bind their stable provider
thread to one agent.

Dedicated numbers remain a premium option:

- request and provision a provider line asynchronously;
- verify the connector, webhook owner, status, and delivery before activation;
- price the line above provider cost with support and reputation risk included;
- quarantine and detach released lines before reuse; and
- support bring-your-own-provider installations only after ownership and
  offboarding contracts are defined.

The current reference deployment uses one Linq line through Vercel Connect. The
planned shared-number product may migrate to the existing Sendblue account via
Eve's Chat SDK channel, but that is not an implemented claim. Migration requires
provider webhook contract tests, stable conversation IDs, inbound/outbound
delivery proof, opt-out handling, throughput limits, and multi-tenant terms.
Only one adapter may own a production line's inbound webhook at a time.

Shared infrastructure concentrates risk. Monitor line reputation, provider
capacity, opt-outs, and abuse per tenant. A tenant suspension must stop its
traffic without disabling unrelated tenants; a line suspension must stop or
fail over every conversation using that line. Add additional shared lines with
sticky conversation assignment when capacity or reputation requires sharding.

## Public API proposal

Expose a platform API under `/v1`; do not expose raw database IDs or make the
framework-owned `/eve/v1/*` contract the long-term customer API.

| Endpoint                                                 | Purpose                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /v1/agents`                                        | Create an agent draft in the authenticated workspace    |
| `GET /v1/agents/:agentId`                                | Read agent state and active revision                    |
| `POST /v1/agents/:agentId/revisions`                     | Validate and create a draft revision                    |
| `POST /v1/agents/:agentId/revisions/:revisionId/publish` | Publish an immutable revision                           |
| `POST /v1/agents/:agentId/channel-bindings`              | Activate shared messaging for a verified phone identity |
| `POST /v1/agents/:agentId/invitations`                   | Create an expiring participant invitation               |
| `POST /v1/channel-conversations/:id/select-agent`        | Explicitly switch a bound conversation                  |
| `POST /v1/agents/:agentId/dedicated-line-requests`       | Request an optional premium dedicated line              |
| `POST /v1/agents/:agentId/connections`                   | Configure an approved catalog/MCP installation          |
| `POST /v1/agents/:agentId/sessions`                      | Create a platform session pinned to the active revision |
| `POST /v1/sessions/:sessionId/messages`                  | Send a turn with idempotency                            |
| `GET /v1/sessions/:sessionId/events`                     | Stream normalized run events                            |
| `POST /v1/webhook-endpoints`                             | Register an outbound event destination                  |
| `GET /v1/usage`                                          | Read tenant usage and limits                            |

API credentials must be workspace-scoped, hashed at rest, shown once, and
limited by explicit scopes such as `agents:read`, `agents:write`,
`sessions:write`, `runs:read`, and `webhooks:write`. Require an
`Idempotency-Key` for resource creation, message delivery, and external actions.
Return stable error codes and request IDs; use cursors rather than exposing
database offsets.

## Customer webhooks

Use a durable outbox and at-least-once delivery. Each event needs a unique ID,
workspace and agent IDs, type, creation time, schema version, correlation ID,
and a data object. Sign the exact raw body with an endpoint-specific secret and
timestamp; reject replay outside the documented window. Customers deduplicate
by event ID.

Initial events:

- `agent.provisioning`, `agent.ready`, `agent.suspended`;
- `channel.activated`, `conversation.bound`, `conversation.switched`;
- `participant.invited`, `participant.joined`, `participant.revoked`;
- `dedicated_line.requested`, `dedicated_line.active`,
  `dedicated_line.status_updated`, `dedicated_line.released`;
- `message.received`, `message.completed`, `message.failed`;
- `run.started`, `run.completed`, `run.failed`;
- `approval.required`, `approval.completed`;
- `connection.authorization_required`, `connection.connected`,
  `connection.revoked`;
- `usage.threshold_reached`.

Retry timeouts, network errors, `429`, and `5xx` with bounded exponential
backoff; treat other `4xx` responses as endpoint/operator failures. Store only a
redacted preview or digest of sensitive payloads in delivery logs. Provide
endpoint disable, secret rotation, test delivery, and replay-by-event controls.

## How the consumer product fits later

The text-to-create experience becomes another authenticated control-plane
client:

1. A platform onboarding number maps the verified sender to a personal
   workspace.
2. A constrained provisioning agent collects purpose, audience, name, and a
   template—not arbitrary executable instructions.
3. The control plane creates an agent draft, selects safe capabilities, and
   binds the owner's provider conversation to that agent after confirmation.
4. The owner confirms the published revision and sharing policy.
5. Guests join with an expiring invitation and receive a participant role on
   the conversation, not workspace admin access.

Group bots then become provider conversation bindings plus participant policy.
Ownership, configuration, billing, and deletion remain with the workspace
owner. This keeps a wedding, party, friend-group, or business bot on the same
platform instead of building a second tenancy model.

## Delivery phases and gates

1. **Tenant foundation:** explicit workspace membership, lifecycle, active
   scope, session ownership, usage, and audit. Gate: two-tenant isolation tests
   pass across DB, Eve, Kernel, Blob, vault, and routes.
2. **Agent resource:** agent/revision model, draft validation, publish and
   rollback. Gate: every session pins one workspace/agent/revision tuple.
3. **Curated capabilities:** tenant-resolved tools, MCP/OpenAPI catalog,
   credential ownership, and approval policy. Gate: wrong-tenant and schema
   drift tests fail closed.
4. **Shared messaging:** verified phone identities, signed and idempotent
   provider webhooks, one-default-agent resolution, durable conversation
   binding, participant policy, and line reputation controls. Gate: two tenants
   use the same platform number for complete inbound/outbound turns without
   cross-tenant state, tool, usage, or audit leakage.
5. **Platform API/webhooks:** scoped keys, idempotency, signed outbox delivery,
   usage and audit endpoints. Gate: replay, rotation, revocation, quota, and
   cross-tenant contract tests.
6. **Shared administration:** invitations and owner/admin/member capabilities.
   Gate: ownership transfer, removal, support access, and deletion rehearsal.
7. **Participant routing:** expiring join codes, explicit agent switching, and
   group-thread binding. Gate: ambiguous routing fails closed and revoked
   participants cannot resume old sessions.
8. **Premium channels:** dedicated-line requests and provider/BYO lifecycle.
   Gate: provisioning, billing, reputation, suspension, release, and quarantine
   tests pass without affecting shared-line tenants.
9. **Consumer shell:** text-to-create templates and guest/group participation.
   Gate: abuse, consent, recovery, moderation, and line reputation review.

## Decisions required before implementation

- Is the MVP customer a developer, an agency, or a small business operator?
- Is billing per workspace, agent, message, run, provider cost, or a
  bundled combination?
- Which curated tools/MCP services ship first, and which operations require
  approval?
- Can the first customer have multiple agents, even if the UI initially exposes
  one?
- Are connections owned by a workspace, an agent, or a user grant attached to
  an agent?
- What are the message, run, screenshot, audit, and released-line retention
  periods?
- What are Sendblue's approved shared-line throughput, multi-tenant terms,
  opt-out contract, and webhook/retry limits?
- What price and service level make a dedicated line viable as a premium
  add-on?
- Which use cases or external actions are prohibited at launch?

## Sources used for this proposal

- Installed Eve 0.46.1 docs: dynamic capabilities, multi-tenant outbound auth,
  multi-tenant approvals, MCP connections, custom channels, route protection,
  security, and Vercel deployment.
- Current Linq Partner API docs: chat sending, webhook subscriptions and
  retries, line status/reputation events, and the non-self-serve phone-number
  provisioning constraint.
- Current Eve registry and Vercel Chat SDK guidance: first-class Linq support
  plus provider-backed Chat SDK adapters, including Sendblue. Vercel supplies
  the runtime integration, not the underlying iMessage line.
- Repository architecture and services described in
  [`ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`](ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md).
