# OpenInstinct documentation

This directory describes the repository as it exists and the product direction
being considered. Documents use three labels deliberately:

- **Implemented** means the behavior exists in this repository.
- **Verified** means the named local or deployed path was exercised on the date
  recorded by the document.
- **Proposed** means a design or launch gate; it is not a production claim.

## Current truth

- The application is a single Next.js 16 application with an Eve 0.46 agent.
- Vercel is the supported deployment target. Neon, Kernel, private Vercel Blob,
  Vercel Workflow/AI Gateway, and Vercel Connect are part of the current path.
- The database and service layer are workspace-scoped, but the product is not
  yet a shared multi-tenant service.
- One Linq connector and one phone line currently configure the deployment.
- `workspace` is the intended customer, isolation, billing, and lifecycle
  boundary. A future `agent` is a separately configurable resource owned by a
  workspace.
- The recommended product sequence is an agent-infrastructure service first,
  followed by a consumer text-to-create experience built on the same API.

## Keep documents honest

When behavior changes, update the nearest owning document in the same change.
Do not turn a proposed schema, API, provider capability, or launch gate into an
implemented claim. Re-run the applicable verification and replace dated
deployment evidence rather than silently carrying it forward.
