# Multi-tenancy design: Vercel-first

This document defines the target for multiple customer workspaces. It is a
design contract, not an implemented claim. The recommended first production
platform is Vercel because the current application already relies on Vercel
Connect, Blob, AI Gateway, and Vercel workflow services.

The proposed product sequence is **agent infrastructure first**: a workspace
owns configurable agents, published revisions, managed channel bindings,
connections, API credentials, and webhooks. The later consumer text-to-create
experience should call that same control plane. See
[`PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md`](PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md) for the two-path comparison,
public API proposal, MCP strategy, and delivery phases.

The existing `workspaces` table is the canonical tenant and billable boundary
for this evolution. Extend `workspaces` and `workspace_memberships`; do not add
a parallel tenant owner table unless a deliberate future rename migration is
approved. Provider identity and installation mapping tables may use
tenant/workspace-keyed names, but their ownership must resolve back to the
canonical workspace.

## Recommended evolution

Stage the change around the boundary that already exists:

1. Preserve each current workspace as the initial tenant boundary.
2. Introduce `agent` as a workspace-owned configurable resource; do not treat
   the workspace, user, agent, and phone line as the same identity.
3. Make personal workspaces explicit, member-authorized, observable, and
   operable before adding shared access.
4. Make a shared platform number the default messaging ingress. Bind each
   provider conversation to one verified phone identity, workspace, agent, and
   published revision.
5. Start with one active/default agent per verified phone. Add invitation codes,
   explicit agent switching, group-thread binding, and premium dedicated lines
   as later contracts.
6. Add shared organizations only after those identity and channel contracts are
   tested end to end.

Better Auth Organizations is a candidate for membership/session primitives, not
a committed dependency. Phone-first invitations, parallel ownership, active
tenant selection, and provider-line ownership must be resolved before adopting
it.

## Isolation invariant

Every request resolves exactly one tenant/workspace server-side from an
authenticated principal and a membership record. Agent-facing requests also
resolve exactly one workspace-owned agent and published revision. A
client-supplied workspace or agent ID is a selector at most, never an authority.
The server must verify membership, role/capability, resource ownership, and
lifecycle state before every read, write, external call, and background
continuation.

Service APIs should accept a typed scope object containing tenant ID, principal
ID, and role claims. Keep workspace predicates in every query and preserve
composite foreign keys. PostgreSQL RLS is a useful defense in depth, but it
must not replace application authorization or transaction-level scope setup.

## Identity and membership

The target model separates these concepts while keeping workspace canonical:

- `user`: Better Auth identity and authentication lifecycle.
- `workspace`: canonical billable customer boundary and data owner (the tenant
  product concept).
- `workspace_membership`: user-to-workspace relationship, role, status, timestamps, and
  invitation provenance.
- `workspace_identity`: verified external subject mapping, provider, and
  workspace.
- `phone_identity`: verified normalized phone subject linked to a Better Auth
  user, including recovery and number-recycling state.
- `workspace_installation`: provider connection/line installation owned by a
  workspace.
- `agent`: stable workspace-owned configurable product resource.
- `agent_revision`: immutable configuration snapshot pinned by new sessions.
- `platform_line`: provider address and connector shared across tenant
  conversations; this is not tenant authority.
- `channel_conversation`: verified provider thread routed to exactly one
  workspace and agent, with an explicit participant set and pinned revision.
- `channel_participant`: verified person allowed to converse without receiving
  workspace administration rights.

The active tenant must come from a server-issued session claim or a server-side
membership lookup. Switching tenants rotates the effective scope and must
invalidate or re-check active Eve sessions, workers, browser profiles, and
connection grants.

The active agent and revision follow the same rule. They must be resolved from
a server-owned channel conversation binding or an authorized API request. A running
session remains pinned to its revision until an explicit reset/migration; a
publish must not silently widen the tools of an already-running session.

Roles should begin with owner, admin, and member. Sensitive operations need
capability checks in addition to role checks: vault administration, connection
management, spending policy, support access, export, and tenant deletion.

## Channels and connections

### Shared iMessage/SMS ingress

The default model is one provider line shared by many tenants. The current code
uses a deployment-level Linq connector and line; the planned product may move
the shared channel to Sendblue through Eve's Chat SDK adapter after a separate
migration and acceptance test. Provider choice must not change the tenant
resolution contract.

For an existing conversation, inbound messages must resolve
`(provider, provider_account_id, provider_conversation_id)` to exactly one
platform line, tenant, agent, revision, and participant set before starting an
Eve session. For a new conversation, the sender must map to a verified phone
identity with exactly one active/default agent before the platform
transactionally creates that binding. Reject ambiguous or unverified routing.
Replies must use the same provider conversation, platform line, tenant, and
agent context as the inbound event.

The first release does not allow a phone identity to select among multiple
agents through arbitrary message text. Later releases add expiring invitations,
an explicit auditable switch operation, and group-thread bindings. Possession of
a phone number never grants web administration rights.

Dedicated or bring-your-own lines remain premium later-stage modes. They add
provider ownership verification, billing, reputation isolation, release,
quarantine, and offboarding; they are not required for the shared-number MVP.

### Google Workspace and Vercel Connect

Persist an installation record containing provider, Vercel Connect connector
ID, tenant ID, authorization subject, scopes, status, and created/rotated times.
Never infer tenant from a connector ID supplied by a browser. The authorization
subject must be derived from the verified tenant membership and the connector
installation selected by server policy.

### Kernel and Blob

Kernel browser profiles, browser sessions, image manifests, and Blob object
prefixes must include an opaque tenant namespace. Every lookup must verify the
tenant before contacting the provider. Do not use a user hash as a substitute
for a membership-aware tenant namespace once shared workspaces exist.

## Billing, quotas, and abuse controls

Create an append-only usage ledger keyed by tenant, user, provider, model,
workflow/session, and operation. Record model tokens, provider cost, browser
runtime, storage bytes, connector calls, and externally visible actions. Chat
summary fields may remain a view/cache, not the billing authority.

Enforce tenant limits before expensive work:

- concurrent Eve sessions and worker tasks;
- browser lifetime and profile writers;
- model tokens and estimated spend;
- Blob bytes, image count, and retention;
- provider messages and outbound actions;
- Google/API request budgets.

Use provider/webhook rate limits, OTP attempt limits, abuse flags, circuit
breakers, and an operator quarantine state. Budget failures must be explicit to
the user and durable enough to prevent a retry storm.

## Lifecycle, privacy, and support

Tenant states should include trial, active, suspended, pending deletion, and
deleted. Suspension stops new sessions and external actions while preserving
enough state for support and export. Deletion must revoke provider grants,
delete or cryptographically render vault data inaccessible, remove Blob and
Kernel objects, cancel workflows, and retain only the minimum audit/legal data.

Support access must be time-bound, tenant-scoped, explicitly audited, and
unable to reveal vault plaintext. Exports must be authenticated, encrypted in
transit and at rest, rate-limited, and expire automatically. Define retention
for messages, workflow events, screenshots, usage, audit events, and provider
diagnostics before launch.

## Observability

Every request, Eve session, worker task, workflow run, provider call, and audit
event should carry tenant ID, installation ID where relevant, and a correlation
ID. Do not put phone numbers, tokens, vault contents, or page secrets in logs.
Dashboards and alerts must support tenant-scoped views without allowing one
customer to query another customer's identifiers.

## Horizontal scaling risks

- Provider channel state, webhook deduplication, and thread continuity need a
  durable/idempotent multi-instance contract; this review does not assert a
  particular in-memory implementation.
- Eve workflow persistence and task-history behavior need durable shared
  storage plus careful single-writer/consumer validation when horizontally
  scaled.
- Kernel profile writer locks need a shared coordination mechanism when workers
  run on multiple instances.
- Webhook retries require durable idempotency keyed by provider event and tenant.
- Blob and Postgres writes need an outbox/reconciliation path for partial failure.

Vercel is the initial recommendation while the current Connect/Blob/workflow
path remains the system of record. Any later Railway or Hetzner design needs a
separate portability review and provider credential implementation.

## Migration stages and gates

1. **Make personal workspaces explicit:** retain deterministic workspace IDs while
   extending workspace/member records with owner authorization, active-tenant
   checks, lifecycle state, and audit visibility. Gate: every existing
   workspace has one explicit owner and all scoped operations are observable.
2. **Introduce versioned agents:** add workspace-owned agents, immutable
   revisions, an active revision pointer, and session pinning without enabling
   customer-defined code. Gate: every new session records one validated
   workspace/agent/revision tuple and revision rollback is auditable.
3. **Model shared membership:** extend workspace/membership records and add
   identity, invitation, installation, policy, usage, and audit records without
   enabling shared writes. Gate: phone/email invitation and ownership-transfer
   decisions are recorded and wrong-tenant access is denied.
4. **Backfill and scope:** backfill each current personal workspace with
   lifecycle fields and its owner membership, then replace derivation with
   membership lookup behind a feature flag. Gate: counts, foreign keys,
   encrypted AAD mappings, and wrong-tenant read/write tests reconcile.
5. **Bind capabilities and shared messaging:** add curated tenant-resolved
   tools and connections, verified phone identities, provider conversation
   bindings, and Google installations. Gate: tool allow-lists, approval,
   signed-webhook verification, sender/default-agent routing, OAuth subject
   mapping, retries, and revocation tests pass for two tenants on one line.
6. **Limits and lifecycle:** enable usage ledger, quotas, audit, suspension,
   retention, and deletion. Gate: budget enforcement is tested before model,
   browser, message, and storage calls.
7. **API and webhook cutover:** expose scoped platform credentials and signed
   durable events. Gate: key rotation, idempotency, webhook replay, and
   wrong-tenant contract suites pass.
8. **Shared cutover:** enable shared tenants for a controlled cohort. Gate:
   complete web-chat and shared-line turns, tenant isolation acceptance,
   ambiguous-routing rejection, rollback rehearsal, and backup restore
   rehearsal all pass.
9. **Participant and premium channels:** add expiring invites, explicit agent
   switching, group-thread bindings, and optional dedicated/BYO lines. Gate:
   participant revocation, line billing, reputation, release, and quarantine
   tests pass independently of the shared channel.

Rollback boundaries must be explicit: schema additions are backward compatible;
membership admission is fail-closed and cannot be disabled in production;
tenant writes after cutover require an export/replay strategy. Roll back with a
compatible prior build or forward repair, never with an authorization bypass.
Never roll back encryption/AAD or membership data by silently recreating a tenant.

## Test strategy

- Unit-test tenant resolution, role/capability policy, provider subject mapping,
  idempotency, quota decisions, and deletion state transitions.
- Integration-test every DB service with two tenants and two members, including
  wrong-tenant IDs, worker lineage, artifacts, secrets, and settings.
- Contract-test each provider webhook and connection installation with retries,
  duplicate events, revoked grants, and malformed tenant mappings.
- Run browser authorization tests proving a worker cannot use another tenant's
  browser, profile, vault item, or artifact.
- Run migration/backfill tests on empty, legacy, partial, and rollback fixtures.
- Exercise complete web-chat and provider turns for two tenants through the
  same staging number with audit and usage records, then rehearse backup restore
  and tenant deletion.

## Threat-model checklist

- Can a caller select another tenant by changing an ID, cursor, or session ID?
- Can a caller select another workspace's agent, revision, connection, or line?
- Can publishing a revision widen the tools of an already-running session?
- Can a provider sender reach a tenant without a verified phone identity and
  server-owned conversation mapping?
- Can one sender with multiple agent memberships cause ambiguous routing or
  select a tenant through arbitrary message text?
- Can a worker child inherit a different tenant than its root session?
- Can retries duplicate a purchase, message, grant, usage charge, or deletion?
- Can support staff or logs expose vault values, OAuth tokens, phone numbers, or screenshots?
- Are quotas checked before external side effects and again on retry?
- Do webhook signatures, replay windows, and installation ownership hold after a proxy hop?
- Does tenant deletion cover Postgres, Blob, Kernel, Eve workflows, provider grants, caches, and logs?

## Open decisions

- Can an MVP workspace own multiple agents even if the first UI exposes one?
- When are invite redemption, explicit agent switching, and group-thread
  binding introduced after the one-default-agent MVP?
- Do Sendblue's commercial terms, throughput, webhook contract, opt-out model,
  and reputation controls permit one shared line across SaaS tenants?
- What price and support contract apply to optional dedicated lines?
- Are external connections workspace-owned, agent-owned, or personal grants
  selected through an agent policy?
- Is a Better Auth user allowed to belong to multiple tenants, and how is the active tenant selected?
- Which roles can manage vault, connectors, billing, support, and spending policy?
- Is customer data residency or regional Kernel placement required?
- Which workflow, message, screenshot, and audit retention periods apply?
- What is the billing authority and reconciliation window for provider-reported cost?
- Which provider integrations are Vercel-only at launch?
- What is the approved support escalation path for a stuck or disputed external action?
